# Applications

Most applications get installed through Homebrew Cask. The apps below need to be installed from the App Store or manually, either probably because I've got a license to it from the App Store, or a license I got elsewhere.

- Quickcast
- Twitter
- Adobe CS
- Antidote 9
- Microsoft Office

- https://github.com/gjrdiesel/homestead56 (If I need to work on Laravel 4)
- http://pictogram.agency/muir/ (Nice icons)
